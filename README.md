A small collection of samples that demonstrate how to call Google Cloud services
from C++.

The samples in this repo cover only a _small fraction_ of the total APIs that
you can call from C++. See the
[googleapis repo](https://github.com/googleapis/googleapis) to see the full list
of APIs callable from C++.

These samples will only build and run on **Linux**.

There is a growing collection of [C++ client libraries] for Google Cloud
services. These include Cloud Bigtable, Cloud Pub/Sub, Cloud Spanner, and Google
Cloud Storage. These libraries include examples of how to use most functions.
The examples in this repository typically involve using a combination of
services, or a more specific use-case.
