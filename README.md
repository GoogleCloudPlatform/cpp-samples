# C++ Samples

A small collection of samples that demonstrate how to call Google Cloud services from C++.

[![style][style-badge]][style-link] [![cloud build][cloud-build-badge]][cloud-build-link]

The samples in this repo cover only a _small fraction_ of the total APIs that you can call from C++. See
the [googleapis repo](https://github.com/googleapis/googleapis) to see the full list of APIs callable from C++.

These samples will only build and run on **Linux**.

There is a growing collection of [C++ client libraries] for Google Cloud services. These include Cloud Bigtable, Cloud
Pub/Sub, Cloud Spanner, and Google Cloud Storage. These libraries include
examples of how to use most functions. The examples in this repository typically
involve using a combination of services, or a more specific use-case.
